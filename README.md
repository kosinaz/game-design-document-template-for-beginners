# Game Design Document template for beginners

The primary goal of a Game Design Document is to organize efforts within the development team of a complex project, but it can be also useful for smaller video games developed by a single person, because it clearly defines the outlines and the most important details and drives the design process. This template has been created to not only serve this purpose but to help beginners learn the ways of writing a good Game Design Document through advices and examples.

## Getting Started

Simply clone or download the Game Design Document.md from the /docs folder.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites.

### Installing

Copy it into your local project folder and start editing it in your favorite text editor. The examples and advices will help you in the process.
